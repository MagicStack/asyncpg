=======
asyncpg
=======

**asyncpg** is a database interface library designed specifically for
PostgreSQL and Python/asyncio.  asyncpg is an efficient, clean implementation
of PostgreSQL server binary protocol for use with Python's ``asyncio``
framework.

**asyncpg** requires Python 3.8 or later and is supported for PostgreSQL
versions 9.5 to 16.  Older PostgreSQL versions or other databases implementing
the PostgreSQL protocol *may* work, but are not being actively tested.
